try5

implement control over expansion parameters (amount, phase, numWaves)
	Array of HashMaps<String, Float>? 

can now save frames:
	glitch: saved png shows previous MultiForms as well, some pixelation
	perhaps not flushing the PShapes? interesting effect 

set colors in configColor(), called at start and at each expansion

Control over stroke and fill w/ PShape implementaion in Form class.
	done with method chaining, HYPE style
	might result in performance problems during animation, may need to figure it out

looks like thai dye without stroke but with varying fill

UI: 
	control color dynamically
	control expansion parameters
	control animation(?)

press q to quit
press . to reverse last expansion
press s to save frame
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
try4

MultiForm implemented to display multiple Forms simultaneously. 

P2D renderer w/ smooth(4) gets rid of aliasing, looks good.

**adding an "amount" parameter to expansion would be convenient for both
  animation and interpolation b/w expModes, it seems. 

things to try:
	can actually pull some decent images now.

	varying fills and strokes of forms. (inside MultiForm)

	having varying amounts of different expansion vectors - interpolating
	between different ones instead of switching suddenly.  

	animating expansion

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
try3

Modes of expansion now selectable with numpad,
names stored in expModes.txt. If new modes added,
add name to the file.

Expansion and computation of expansion vector seperated,
new expansions can be introduced by adding new methods for 
calculating exp vector.

introduced MultiForm, to display expanded and non- forms 
together without cheap background trick. to be filled

Expand with Enter, reset with space.

altering parameters of expansion vectors?????

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
try2

Basic expansion of a Form. Have to go into class to alter mode of expansion.
Modes so far involve random, noise, and sin, or combinations of these.
Storing all expansion vectors in an ArrayList for future use  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
try1

Wrote the Form class:
	basic addition of points and display modes
		*thinking about displaying points as a PShape to alter 
		 stroke and fill independently from the rest of sketch
	ability to arrange points in a circle
